Question: do we need to create a MondoDB 
database manually, or can we do it in our
app, using mongoose?

New ubuntu command: 'ps' : displays 
information about a selection of 
currently active processes. Adding the
-ef flag to this command makes it dislpay
all currently active processes.

grep: a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular expression. Its name comes from the ed command g/re/p (globally search a regular expression and print)

 |  <--- This is a pipe. It is used in ubuntu
 tp send the output of one program to another
 program for further processing.

 ...

 ps -ef | grep mongo

 ... returns a list of currently active 
 processes, then searches that list for 
 anything with the word 'mongo' in it, and
 displays that to us.

 Holy moley, we can run 'mongo' on our terminal from anywhere on our system.
